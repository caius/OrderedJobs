# Ordered Jobs

My solution for the [OrderedJob kata][kata]. It's mostly an exercise in how to not write ruby, nor solve dependency data structures. But the specs pass.

It's **not** pretty. And uses far less variables than it should. And has a magical invocation of `Array#reverse` to pass the tests.
